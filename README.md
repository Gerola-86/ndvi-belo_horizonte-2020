# ndvi-belo_horizonte-2020
Normalized vegetation index of Belo Horizonte - 2020
script for the temporal analysis of the normalized vegetable mass index of Belo Horizonte.
Project Description: The goal of this project is to use Google Earth Engine (GEE) to visualize and analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for this specific region. NDVI is an important indicator for assessing vegetation health.
The data obtained can be correlated with other data in order to generate information regarding climate change, for example.

Storing this project's documentation in a GitHub repository aims to highlight skills in geospatial data analysis.
